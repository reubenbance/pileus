  <h1>Support the Pileus Fund</h1>
  <p>This fund supports individuals working to preserve truth and freedom in the most dangerous places on Earth. Journalists, protestors, and any other individual or group operating within a hostile environment can apply for emergency grants from the Fund, if they can demonstrate that receiving funding through traditional financial infrastructure is either impossible or life threatening.</p>

  <p>If you have questions or want to make an application for funding, contact us: <a href="mailto:pileus.fund@proton.me">pileus.fund@proton.me</a>. If you are applying for funding, DO NOT SHARE ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION BY EMAIL - a secure communication channel will be set up to discuss the details of your situation and the specific needs for funding.</p>
  
  <h2>Accountability and Auditing</h2>
  <p>In order for the Fund's administrators to be held accountable to donors and other supporters, the entire Fund's balance will be transferred to a viewable account address for 24 hours once a quarter, with the account address and private view key being published on this webpage for those 24 hours. This will allow anyone to view the Fund's balance once a quarter. After the 24 hour period has passed, the total Fund balance will be transferred back into a cold wallet for storage. Alongside the published account address and private view key, a report will be released detailing any incoming donations and outgoing fund payments during the preceding quarter (with sensitive information on Fund recipients redacted). The first of these public audits will take place on July 1st, 2025, at the Fund's launch. Should the Fund need to be liquidated for any reason, all held crypto assets will be donated to the Monero development team and the Tor Project in equal measure.</p>
